## Installation process
The technology used to implement the programm is a simple Jupyter Notebook file wich containts 

#### _Open Computer Vision library_
Most of the functions used are from the OpenCV library. If not installed already, just copy paste on the console the following.
```bash
  pip install opencv-python
```

#### _Pynput library_
Our program needs to be able to handle the clicks without using the mouse. With that porpose, Pynput provides us a Controller to detect them.
```bash
  pip install pynput
```
